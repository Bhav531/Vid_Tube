# Vid_Tube
 This project is a static front-end clone of YouTube, built using only HTML and CSS. It replicates the layout, including the header, sidebar, and video grid, with responsive design. Though non-functional, it showcases how HTML and CSS alone can create a clean, modern, and professional web interface.
