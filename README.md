YouTube Homepage Clone (HTML & CSS)
This repository contains a fully responsive, static front-end clone of the YouTube homepage, created using only HTML5 and CSS3. It is a layout and styling project that replicates the look and structure of YouTube’s homepage without incorporating any JavaScript or backend functionality.

Project Overview
This project was built as a way to practice front-end development skills and UI/UX design. It mirrors the core structure of YouTube’s interface, including the header, sidebar, and main video content area. The focus is on achieving a clean, professional layout using pure HTML and CSS, while ensuring responsiveness across various screen sizes.

The project showcases how far front-end developers can go in recreating real-world web interfaces using just foundational technologies. Every section—from the navigation bar to the responsive video grid—has been carefully coded to reflect YouTube’s modern design.
